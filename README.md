# Drug-consumption-analysis

As part of our project for <ins>**Python for Data Analysis**</ins>, we decided to use the <ins>drug-consumption-data.data</ins> dataset for implementing Machine Learning. After analysing our dataset and links between variables through graphs and correlations, we decided to implement a target variable to predict whether a user is or may become a drug addict. 

# Necessary installations

In your command prompt, run the following command : **pip install -r requirement.txt**  

This will do all the necessary pip installations so that you can run the notebook or the website.

# Running the website

If you want to run the website, you need to go to your command prompt and access to the Streamlit folder you downloaded in this Github, you can do so by using the cd command.  Like .> <ins>cd *absolute path to the folder*</ins>

Once you are there, type the following :   
**python -m streamlit run menu.py**  
  
Just typing *streamlit run menu.py* can work but the above one is sure to work.  

Your default browser will then open the website locally on your device.
