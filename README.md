# Drug-consumption-analysis

As part of our project for <ins>**Python for Data Analysis**</ins>, we decided to use the <ins>drug-consumption-data.data</ins> dataset for implementing Machine Learning. After analysing our dataset and links between variables through graphs and correlations, we decided to implement a target variable to predict whether a user is or may become a drug addict. 

# Necessary installations

## For notebook

pip install numpy  
pip install matplotlib  
pip install seaborn  
pip install pandas  
pip install scipy  
pip install sklearn  
pip install category_encoders  
pip install xgboost  

## For website

For our project, we used streamlit as well as streamlit-option-menu to develop the web part of our project.

pip install streamlit  
pip install streamlit-option-menu  

# Running the website

If you want to run the website, you need to go to your command prompt and access to the Streamlit folder you downloaded in this Github, you can do so by using the cd command.  Like .> <ins>cd *absolute path to the folder*</ins>

Once you are there, type the following :   
**python -m streamlit run menu.py**  
  
Just typing *streamlit run menu.py* can work but the above one is sure to work.  

Your default browser will then open the website locally on your device.
