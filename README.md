# Drug-consumption-analysis

As part of our project for <ins>**Python for Data Analysis**</ins>, we decided to use the <ins>drug-consumption-data.data</ins> dataset for implementing Machine Learning. After analysing our dataset and links between variables through graphs and correlations, we decided to implement a target variable to predict whether a user is or may become a drug addict.
