# Drug-consumption-analysis

As part of our project for <ins>**Python for Data Analysis**</ins>, we decided to use the <ins>drug-consumption-data.data</ins> dataset for implementing Machine Learning. After analysing our dataset and links between variables through graphs and correlations, we decided to implement a target variable to predict whether a user is or may become a drug addict. 
Drug-analysis_Matthias_Picard-SÃ©verin_LEFEBURE_ESILV_Project.ipynb is a presentation of our project: the ins and outs, our methodology, the results of our model and the limits of our analysis.
Our Streamlit contains all the graphs that we created (data analysis and model) and their interpretation. The notebook contains all the codes that generated our graphs and our results.

# Necessary installations

In your command prompt, go to the folder of the zip file you downloaded in the Github :  
cd Drug-consuption-analysis  

and then run the following command :  
**pip install -r requirement.txt**  

This will do all the necessary pip installations so that you can run the notebook or the website.

# Running the website

If you want to run the website, you need to go to your command prompt and access to the Streamlit folder you downloaded in this Github :  
  
cd Drug-consuption-analysis/Streamlit

Once you are there, type the following :   
**python -m streamlit run menu.py**  
  
Just typing *streamlit run menu.py* can work but the above one is sure to work.  

Your default browser will then open the website locally on your device.
